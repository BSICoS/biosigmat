# biosigmat

A MATLAB library for biomedical signal processing. This library is currently under development and will include methods for processing and analyzing various biomedical signals.

## Overview

Biosigmat aims to provide comprehensive tools for processing biomedical signals and performing advanced analysis:

### Signal Processing
- PPG (Photoplethysmography)
- ECG (Electrocardiography)
- Respiratory signals

### Analysis Methods
- HRV (Heart Rate Variability) - can be applied to both PPG and ECG signals

## Repository Structure

The code is organized by signal type:
```
src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ ppg/     # Photoplethysmography signal processing ðŸš§ (planned)
  â”œâ”€â”€ ecg/     # Electrocardiography signal processing
  â”œâ”€â”€ hrv/     # Heart Rate Variability analysis
  â”œâ”€â”€ resp/    # Respiratory signal processing ðŸš§ (planned)
  â””â”€â”€ tools/   # General purpose signal processing tools
test/
  â”œâ”€â”€ ppg/     # Tests for PPG processing ðŸš§ (planned)
  â”œâ”€â”€ ecg/     # Tests for ECG processing
  â”œâ”€â”€ hrv/     # Tests for HRV analysis
  â”œâ”€â”€ resp/    # Tests for respiratory processing ðŸš§ (planned)
  â””â”€â”€ tools/   # Tests for general tools
examples/
  â”œâ”€â”€ ppg/       # Simple examples of PPG processing ðŸš§ (planned)
  â”œâ”€â”€ ecg/       # Simple examples of ECG processing
  â”œâ”€â”€ hrv/       # Simple examples of HRV analysis
  â”œâ”€â”€ resp/      # Simple examples of respiratory processing ðŸš§ (planned)
  â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/ # Complex examples combining multiple functions
  â””â”€â”€ tutorials/ # Educational step-by-step examples ðŸš§ (planned)
```

Each signal-specific module contains relevant processing methods with corresponding tests and examples.

### Examples Organization

- **Signal-specific directories** (`ppg/`, `ecg/`, `hrv/`, `resp/`): Simple examples demonstrating individual functions
- **`workflows/`**: Complex examples that combine multiple tools and functions to solve real-world biomedical signal processing problems
- **`tutorials/`**: Educational examples focusing on specific signal processing concepts and techniques ðŸš§ (planned)
