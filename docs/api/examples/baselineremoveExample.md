# `baselineremoveExample` - Example demonstrating baseline wander removal from ECG signals.

## Description

This example demonstrates how to effectively remove baseline wander from real ECG signals using the baselineremove function. The process involves loading ECG signal data from a CSV file and applying baseline removal techniques to eliminate low-frequency artifacts that can interfere with ECG analysis. The example shows the comparison between original and processed signals through visualization, highlighting the effectiveness of the baseline removal algorithm in preserving the ECG morphology while eliminating unwanted baseline drift.
