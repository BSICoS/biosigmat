# `tdmetricsExample` - Example demonstrating time-domain heart rate variability analysis.

## Description

This example demonstrates how to compute time-domain heart rate variability (HRV) metrics from ECG R-peak timing data using the tdmetrics function. The process begins by loading pre-calculated R-peak timing data from CSV fixture files. The R-peak intervals are then computed and used as input to the tdmetrics function, which calculates various time-domain HRV parameters including statistical measures of RR interval variability.
