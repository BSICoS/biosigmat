# `fillgapsExample`

Example demonstrating gap filling in RR interval time series.

## Description

This example demonstrates how to fill gaps in RR interval time series using the fillgaps function. The process involves loading ECG timing data from a CSV file, simulating missing detections by removing some R-peak timing values, and then applying the gap filling algorithm to interpolate the missing intervals. The example shows the comparison between original and filled RR interval series through visualization, highlighting the effectiveness of the gap filling algorithm in maintaining physiological plausibility of the RR intervals.
