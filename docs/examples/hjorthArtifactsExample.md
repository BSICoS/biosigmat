# `hjorthArtifactsExample`

Example demonstrating artifact detection using Hjorth parameters.

## Description

This example demonstrates how to detect artifacts in photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using Hjorth parameters analysis. The process involves loading PPG signal data from a CSV file and applying the hjorthArtifacts function to identify signal segments that contain artifacts based on activity, mobility, and complexity parameters. The example shows how to configure detection margins for different Hjorth parameters and visualizes both the artifact detection vector and the parameter matrix, providing insights into signal quality assessment for PPG analysis applications.
