# `pcaverageWorkflow`

Workflow demonstrating peak-conditioned average processing.

## Description

This workflow demonstrates the peak-conditioned average processing technique applied to respiratory signal analysis. The process begins by loading respiratory signal data from CSV fixture files and applying detrending to remove linear trends that could affect the analysis. The signal is then systematically sliced into segments for processing. Power spectral density is computed for each segment using the nanpwelch function, enabling frequency-domain analysis of the respiratory patterns. This workflow is particularly useful for analyzing periodic respiratory signals and extracting spectral characteristics that can provide insights into breathing patterns and respiratory system behavior.
