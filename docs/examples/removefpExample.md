# `removefpExample`

Example demonstrating false positive removal from RR interval time series.

## Description

This example demonstrates how to remove false positive detections from RR interval time series using the removefp function. The process involves loading ECG timing data from a CSV file and applying the false positive removal algorithm to eliminate beats that are too close together. The example shows the comparison between original and cleaned RR interval series through visualization, highlighting the effectiveness of the false positive removal algorithm in improving signal quality.
