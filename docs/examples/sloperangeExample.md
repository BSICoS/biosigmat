# SLOPERANGEEXAMPLE Example demonstrating ECG-derived respiration using slope range method

## Description

This example shows how to:

## Steps

1. This example shows how to: - Load ECG signals and R-peak timing data - Preprocess ECG signal with bandpass filtering - Calculate ECG derivative for slope analysis - Apply the sloperange function to extract respiratory signal - Visualize the results with multiple subplots
2. The example uses fixture data from CSV files containing: - ECG signal sampled at 256 Hz - Pre-calculated R-peak timing in seconds
