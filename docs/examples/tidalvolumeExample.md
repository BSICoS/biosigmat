# `tidalvolumeExample`

Example demonstrating tidal volume estimation from respiration signals.

## Description

This example demonstrates how to estimate tidal volume from respiration signals using the tidalvolume function. The process involves loading a respiration signal derived from electrodermal activity (EDR), applying low-pass filtering to remove noise, and then using the tidalvolume algorithm to extract upper and lower envelopes that represent the tidal volume estimation. The example shows the effectiveness of the envelope-based approach in extracting breathing patterns and volume variations from respiratory signals, providing visualization of both the original signal with envelopes and the resulting tidal volume estimation.
